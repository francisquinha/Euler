     * The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 552 = 3025.
     * Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the
     * square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640. Find the difference between the sum of the squares of
     * the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
